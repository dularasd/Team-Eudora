# Team-Eudora
SLRC Robotics competition 2024 - University of jaffna team


🚀 Project Overview

A multipurpose autonomous robot capable of:


                   ✅ Precise line-following using PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control

                   🎨 Real-time color recognition to identify marked zones

                   🧲 Metal detection for obstacle recognition and task performance

                   ⚙️ Custom mechanical design using SolidWorks

                   🧠 Fully programmable with Arduino microcontrollers

                   🔌 Bespoke circuit design for sensor integration and power management



🧩 Key Features

1. 🔄 PID Line Following
   Uses infrared sensor array (QTR or TCRT-based)

   Dynamically adjusts motor speed for smooth, accurate navigation

  
2. 🎨 Color Recognition
   TCS34725 color sensor

   Identifies colored zones (e.g., red/blue/green) for task-specific behavior

3. 🧲 Metal Detection
   Inductive proximity sensor

    Triggers alerts or actions when metallic objects are detected

4. 🖥️ Arduino Programming
   Written in C++ using Arduino IDE

   Modular code structure for sensor abstraction and motor control

   Serial monitoring for debugging and calibration

5. 🧰 Custom PCB & Circuit Design
   Designed using KiCad (or mention actual software used)

   Power regulation, sensor signal conditioning, and motor driver integration

6. 🧱 Mechanical Design
   CAD model built in SolidWorks

   3D-printed chassis and laser-cut mounts

   Compact, durable design optimized for SLRC competition rules
