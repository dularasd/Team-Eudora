# Team-Eudora
SLRC Robotics competition 2024 - University of jaffna team

🚀 Project Overview
A multipurpose autonomous robot capable of:

✅ Precise line-following using PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control

🎨 Real-time color recognition to identify marked zones

🧲 Metal detection for obstacle recognition and task performance

⚙️ Custom mechanical design using SolidWorks

🧠 Fully programmable with Arduino microcontrollers

🔌 Bespoke circuit design for sensor integration and power management

🧩 Key Features
1. 🔄 PID Line Following
Uses infrared sensor array (QTR or TCRT-based)

Dynamically adjusts motor speed for smooth, accurate navigation

2. 🎨 Color Recognition
TCS34725 color sensor

Identifies colored zones (e.g., red/blue/green) for task-specific behavior

3. 🧲 Metal Detection
Inductive proximity sensor

Triggers alerts or actions when metallic objects are detected

4. 🖥️ Arduino Programming
Written in C++ using Arduino IDE

Modular code structure for sensor abstraction and motor control

Serial monitoring for debugging and calibration

5. 🧰 Custom PCB & Circuit Design
Designed using KiCad (or mention actual software used)

Power regulation, sensor signal conditioning, and motor driver integration

6. 🧱 Mechanical Design
CAD model built in SolidWorks

3D-printed chassis and laser-cut mounts

Compact, durable design optimized for SLRC competition rules
